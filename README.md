ðŸ“š PodPortal- A Web App using data fetching from a Public API

Project Description: A Web App that allows users to sign in to their accounts, browse a vast list of podcasts, add episodes to their favourites list, and listen to podcasts while browsing.

Instructions: In order to benefit from the code that I have written, you can click on the green button("<>Code") in this repository and download the zip file. You can then extract it and create a local folder on your computer to store the files. Open the files in a code editor, such as VS code to view and edit the contents of your copy of the files. You can use VS Code's "live-server" extension to view the result of the code in a live server.

Features: This project is a Wep App called PodPortal that allows a user to search through a list of podcasts and filter it by specific title or genre. Users can also sort podcasts into alphabetical, reverse alphabetical, newest to oldest, and oldest to newest order. Users are able to add specific podcast episodes to their favourites list which is stored in Local storage, and will therefore remain if they leave the Page or refresh it. They can view htese favourites on a favourites page. They are also able to listen to podcasts while browsing via a global audioplayer. 

Technologies used: JavaScript, React, SupaBase,React Audio Player Framework, MUI Components,VS Code, Git, and GitHub.
